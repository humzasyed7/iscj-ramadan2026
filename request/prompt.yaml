 Build a landing page "skeleton" to collect donations for a non-profit organization during a 1-month fundraising campaign.
 In this first iteration, the page should just function as a schematic, containing placeholders for titles, logos, images, and CTA buttons that contain placeholder hyperlinks.
 Necessary components include:
 1) the organization logo (either top center or top left)
 2) a hero image (semi transparent banner with text over it)
 3) a title (over the hero banner)
 4) various text blocks for testimonials and other descriptions
 5) a prominent "Donate Now" button.
 
 The design should be simple and clean, with a focus on usability and accessibility.

source_constraints: |
 The site should be built using JavaScript and React, and should be responsive to different screen sizes.
 Users are expected to interact with this site across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
