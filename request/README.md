# Site Brief Instructions

Edit `site-brief.yaml` to describe the experience you want to generate. Keep everything in this file so the assistant has a single source of truth.

Suggested workflow:

1. Duplicate the template fields as needed to describe your project.
2. Save the file before running the aggregation command so your updates are captured.
3. If you need to manage multiple website requests, create additional `.yaml` files in this folder (e.g., `site-brief-2025-10-16.yaml`).

> Tip: Commit the version of the brief you used alongside the generated site so you have a traceable history of requests.
