# Source Material Drop Zone

Place any reference files that should inform the generated website inside this folder. Supported formats include:

- `.docx` — Word documents
- `.pdf` — Adobe Portable Document Format
- `.pptx` — PowerPoint decks
- `.txt` — Plain text notes or transcripts

## Tips

- Keep filenames short and descriptive, e.g., `toastmasters-brief.docx`.
- Remove personally identifiable information before committing files.
- If you have multiple revisions, prepend them with a sequence such as `01-`, `02-`, etc.

When you are ready to generate a site, run the aggregation script from the project root; it will automatically sweep every file in this folder.
